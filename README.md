### Hi there 👋 I'm Kong

I’m a **Full Stack Web Developer** at Humber Polytechnic with a passion for creating clean, functional, and visually balanced digital experiences.

I’m passionate about:
- 🎨 Minimal, thoughtful design
- 🛠️ Turning ideas into real projects with code
- 🌱 Learning and experimenting with new technologies

I’m currently deepening my skills in JavaScript, SQL, C#, PHP, and the MERN stack.

When I’m not coding, I enjoy reading, exploring nature, appreciating art and architecture, or discovering new music.

Before web developer, I spent more than 15 years in leadership, customer relations, and operations. That experience shaped how I lead teams, communicate clearly, and approach problems with creativity. Now, I’m combining those strengths with my technical skills to build user-focused products and practical digital solutions.
